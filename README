Top10 Notebook Description: Using the 311_Service_Requests_2020 file, 
we created a dataframeto look at all incidents in our zip code (10027).
We found the top 10 complaint types (our output is a Pandas Series).

Parking Notebook Description: Using the same 311_Service_Requests_2020 file,
we looked for illegal parking notices in our zip code (10027). We calculated
the percentage of total illegal parking notices out of all parking violations and compared the data to Columbia University's zip code.
